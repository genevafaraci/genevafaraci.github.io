Personal Site Design Doc
==========================
Was originally based off my website for my intro to web programming class. Since then I have given it a major overhaul, updating the entire design.

Using a bootstrap theme that I edited the color scheme for. Most of the focus was on the content. Prior I had not utilized bootstrap and all it had to offer other than the navigation. With this redesign it utilizes favicons, responsive design and columns. When working on the design I wanted to make sure that it was clean and not too cluttered. Keeping with only three colors, all blues, it keeps it simple where as some other color schemes have so many colors it can get annoying. [5 points]

The main page gives a brief overview of who I am while the other pages it links to can highlight on certain aspects.

The theme I choose had this great section of one of the pages that showed the companies they had worked for. I wanted to use this to show just a couple of the companies I have worked for over the years and if a user wanted to know more about my work history they could look at my resume. It took some time to find logos i could edit for a transparent background.

The map that appears on the contact page is not an embedded google map but it is taken from there. The original design had this close up of a harbor, where the fake company was meant to be located. It took me some time to figure out how to get a picture of the terrain with the text, it took some playing around with Google Earth. The area I choose to show has the state where I'm from and the state that I am currently going to school in. I didn't want to focus on my home town because who knows where I will be in the next couple of years.

I was originally going to have my resume be an embedded LinkedIn profile, but their documentation on their API made it very hard to only show one users profile instead of one someone had signed in as. I choose instead to link to my public LinkedIn page incase the person does not have an account they can still view my resume.

My cool plugin that I found this past summer was a timeline program that ran off of a google excel document. With that information in can create an interactive timeline. Originally I had my work history and my portfolio embedded into the timeline but I choose to only do my portfolio. It would not be that hard if I choose to down the time to change the timeline to include both since i saved all the formatted data. I also linked a lot of my work in using google docs publish feature to display the papers I have worked on. [5 points]

Form validation is simple and while I tried to use PHP to send an email directly from my website, I continued to encounter errors and choose to stick with an mailto function instead. Bootstrap does do email validate and while i thought about including one for names, I realized that some users might only want to give their email and their comment. [1 point]
